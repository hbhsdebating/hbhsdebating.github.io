It can take many forms, from parliamentary debate where many small teams present views and offer points of information, to turncoat debates, where a single person presents both sides of the argument and concludes which is best, to the Australasia debate, with two teams of three arguing for or against a motion, which is the format that HBHS debating takes.</p></article><article><h2>What do you do in debating?</h2><p>Juniors (years 9-10) or seniors (years 11-13) form teams of three speakers, plus one or two reserves. You compete against schools all around the Waikato (actually just Hamilton) on Tuesdays (for juniors) or Thursdays (for seniors), about once every few weeks. As you win or lose, you are paired against teams of similar strength, and in term 3 there are semi-finals and finals for the top teams.</p></article></main><footer><p>Made by Jacob Cheatley</p></footer></div></body></html>
