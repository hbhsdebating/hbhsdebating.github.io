If you think you're already pretty confident with speaking, well that's great, debating is another way to test yourself and learn more.</p></article><article><h2>Friends</h2><p>Of course you can and should make a team with your friends, and this is a great extra way to work together with them and learn and have fun. You may even make new friends who share common interests.</p></article><article><h2>Competition</h2><p>Every few weeks there is a round of debating against high school teams around Hamilton (and a little further away). As these rounds progress, the best teams will be put into quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final-finals. There isn't really a prize for winning this competition, but hey, it's fun and you get bragging rights.</p><p>There is also the Waikato Russel McVeagh debating competition, which we have recently done <a href="http://www.hbhs.school.nz/News/HBHS-Senior-Debating-Team-win-Russell-McVeagh-Competition">very well in.</a> From this competition, there are various opportunity to move onto further national and international competitions.</p><p>Every year a senior and junior debating team from HBHS are sent to compete in the <a href="http://www.super8.co.nz/">Super 8</a> competition against 7 other boys schools from around the North Island. Doing well in this helps the school in the competition and gives a chance to travel a bit away from school for a couple of days.</p></article><article><h2>Service Opportunities</h2><p>Experienced senior debaters have the opportunity to do adjudication for junior debates. As well as helping out and gaining service hours, you will also assuredly learn a lot from this to help you further with debating.</p></article></main><footer><p>Made by Jacob Cheatley</p></footer></div></body></html>
