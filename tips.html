A good hook is also important, going straight into a boring introduction is not the best thing to do. A short, snappy phrase that sums up their team's case is good for this. Additionally they may want to define the moot.</p><p><strong>Possibly Model</strong><br>In a change debate, the affirmative first speaker needs to provide a model, that is, a precise way in which this change would be carried out - make sure to cover who would enforce this, who would pay for it, and other specifics depending on the case. The negative first speaker may, and probably should, point out flaws in the affirmative team's model.</p><p><strong>Possibly Rebuttal</strong><br>Only the first negative can do rebuttal (as the first affirmative hasn't heard anyone talk yet). This should be kept brief as the first speaker needs to spend a lot of time on the teams main points.</p><p><strong>Substantive Points</strong><br>The most important thing in any debate are the arguments. The first speaker should bring out the main and key points and develop them as well as possible. This is essential for a team's case to be persuasive, and is the bulk of the first speaker's time spent.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>A brief recap of a first speaker's substantive points is a useful summary. At the end of any speaker's speech, it is generally customary to say some variation of the moot stands/falls, depending on which side of the argument they are on.</p></article></div><div id="second" class="panel"><article><h2>Second Speaker</h2><p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>A second speaker needs only to introduce their points, but they should use a good hook similarly to the first speaker as well (the same line throughout will help with teamwork points).</p><p><strong>Rebuttal</strong><br>The second speaker is the first chance for some proper rebuttal. A little less than half of the speech should be rebuttal. Attacking any flaws in the opposing teams arguments in the order they were brought up is probably the easiest way to achieve this.</p><p><strong>Substantive Points</strong><br>Substantive points are also very important for the second speaker. Anything not covered in the first speaker's speech should be covered in depth here. A second speaker's substantive points should focus on some additional, but alternate approaches to the first speaker, although some overlap (and extension) can also be done.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>Similarly to the first speaker, a conclusion should summarise the second speaker's substantive points, and state that the moot stands/falls.</p></article></div><div id="third" class="panel"><article><h2>Third Speaker</h2><p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>A third speaker's introduction should be a continuation of the team's hook, as well as a split of the main points of the debate so far. This is generally done in the format of "I think this debate has come down to 2-3 main points," followed by a list of these points.</p><p><strong>Rebuttal</strong><br>Rebuttal should, if possible, be grouped within these main points. A third speaker's entire speech is rebuttal, and so a fair amount of detail should go into this. See the rebuttal section for more details. A third speaker should not bring up any substantive points at all during their debate, they will be discounted.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>A good summary for a third speaker would be a brief recap of the main points, and how your team has shown they are right on them.</p></article></div><div id="leader" class="panel"><article><h2>Leader's Reply</h2><p><strong>Summing Up</strong><br>A leader's reply is generally done by the first speaker of a team, although it may be the second. This is a short recap of the debate, in a similar style to a third speaker, by discussing the main points and importantly why their team has won each of these points.</p><aside class="point-of-information undefined"><br/>Did you know that there are no points of information during a leader's reply?</aside></article></div></div></div></article><a href="images/full/prep.jpg" title="Preparing well" class="float-right"><img src="images/prep.jpg" width="187.5" height="250" alt="Preparing well"/></a><article><h2>Developing Points</h2><p>Depth and quantity of argument is key in debating. It is important to look at as many perspectives as possible, and also over many time scales, from immediate to very long term. Good view points are not only all obviously affected groups, but also the broader effects on economic, social, environmental and political situations. This will increase the depth of points, and in turn, gain you more points. The best time to do this is in the <span title="generally teams get half an hour to prepare before a debate" class="tool-tip">prep room.</span></p></article><article><h2>Signposting</h2><p>It is hard to follow an unlabeled and confusing argument. By explicitly stating that you are moving onto your first substantive point, or moving onto rebuttal, it makes it very clear for the <span title="person judging the debate" class="tool-tip">adjudicator</span> what you are doing, helping them and you.</p></article><article><h2>Rebuttal</h2><p><span title="rebuttal is the act of countering an argument" class="tool-tip">Rebuttal</span>  should, in a similar way to how points are developed, be developed as in depth as possible. Consider all relevant viewpoints and time scales. It is important to reference the opponent who said what you are rebutting against, but do not speak to the person, speak to the adjudicator.</p></article><article><h2>Points of Information</h2><aside class="point-of-information float-left"><br/>Are you aware that POI's can only be given between 1 minute after the start and 1 minute before the end of a speech?</aside><p>Points of information are short questions given during and opponents speech designed to point out flaws their argument, or trip them up. When given a <span title="point of information" class="tool-tip">POI</span> you may choose to accept it or decline it before the question is asked. When answering a POI, be sure not to talk to the opposing team, instead give your answer to the adjudicator. Also, don't be scared to stop and think for a moment before answering.</p></article><article><h2>Teamwork</h2><p>Having a consistent argument throughout is basic, and essential. A catch phrase or team line is a simple way to gain teamwork points. Referring to what other speakers on your team has said (e.g. 'as my first speaker said') is also another simple way to make your team's argument more cohesive.</p></article><article><h2>Manner of Speaking and Body Language</h2><p>It is never a good idea to talk at the opposing team. Your discussion and argument is focused on the adjudicator and the adjudicator alone. Eye contact is a good thing as well. Some hand motions should be used for clarity, but excessive movement may be distracting for an adjudicator.</p></article></main><footer><p>Made by Jacob Cheatley</p></footer></div></body></html>
